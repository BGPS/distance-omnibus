###========== README ==========###

This README is for the dpdf/ directory of the distance-omnibus code repository.
These routines compute Distance Probability Density Functions, and form the
core of the code.

Each prob_*.pro routine returns a DPDF with unit total probability.  Which 
routines are run, and the order in which they are computed, are determined by 
the dpdf_params.conf configuration file.  A value of 0 or blank indicates that 
the  associated routine will not be run, integers greater than zero specify the 
order in which the DPDFs are run.

Currently extant DPDF routines are:
------------------------------------
prob_emaf.pro        -- EMAF morphological matching of Ellsworth-Bowers (2013)
prob_grsmatch.pro    -- Extracts a spectrum from 13CO GRS cubes -- KDIST
prob_h2.pro          -- Molecular hydrogen (H2) distribution
prob_hisa.pro**      -- HI Self-Absorption
prob_irdc.pro**      -- Old IRDC routine
prob_kdist.pro       -- Kinematic distance DPDF
prob_maser.pro**     -- Association with masers

** Not currently supported, and will kick a warning in distance_omnibus.pro
------------------------------------

As other methods are developed, the new routines will be placed in this
directory, and entires in dpdf_params.conf will be added.
