###========== README ==========###

This README is for the dpdf/ directory of the distance-omnibus code repository.
These routines compute Distance Probability Density Functions, and form the
core of the code.

Each prob_*.pro routine returns a DPDF with unit total probability.  Which 
routines are run, and the order in which they are computed, are determined by 
the dpdf_params.conf configuration file.  A value of 0 or blank indicates that 
the  associated routine will not be run, integers greater than zero specify the 
order in which the DPDFs are run.

Currently extant DPDF routines are:
------------------------------------
prob_emaf.pro        -- EMAF morphological matching (1)
prob_grsmatch.pro    -- Extracts kinematic distance from GRS 13CO data (2)
prob_h2.pro          -- Molecular hydrogen (H2) distribution (1)
prob_kdist.pro       -- Kinematic distance DPDF (1)
prob_hrds.pro        -- Apply KDA resolution of HRDS HII regions (2)
prob_parallax.pro    -- Apply trigonometric parallax distance (2)
prob_knownd.pro      -- Manually assign distances to known regions (2)

------------------------------------

With the development of additional DPDF methods, the assocated prob_*.pro
routines will be placed in this directory, and corresponding entries in
conffiles/dpdf_params.conf will be added.
