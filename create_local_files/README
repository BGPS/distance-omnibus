The create_local_files/ directory contains the routines necessary to generate
many of the large files (or collections of files) in the local/ directory.  It
seemed more streamlined to move these functions to their own directory so that
the local/ directory may be less populated with files under version control.

Contents of the create_local_files/ directory:

   FOUNDATIONAL ROUTINES (CREATE OFT-USED IDL SAVE FILES):
assoc_bgps_bolocat.pro -- Associates the Bolocat objects with the BGPS released 
		       	  maps and creates the IDL save file 
			  local/BGPS_v102_map_locations.sav (often called the 
			  'map locations' file).

   POSTAGE-STAMP CREATION ROUTINES:
bgps_postage.pro           -- Routine to create the postage-stamp images for
			      BGPS sources.  Places images in the 
			      local/postage directory.
glimpse_postage.pro        -- Routine to create the postage-stamp images from
			      the GLIMPSE Band 4 maps.  Places images in the 
			      local/postage directory.
igps_continuum_postage.pro -- Routine to create the postage-stamp images from
			      the IGPS continuum maps.  Places images in the 
			      local/postage directory.
grs_postage.pro            -- Routine to create the postage-stamp images from
			      velocity-integrating the GRS data cubes over
			      the dense-gas velocity profile.  Places images 
			      in the local/postage directory.
hi_postage.pro             -- Routine to create the postage-stamp images from
			      velocity-integrating the HI data cubes over
			      the dense-gas velocity profile.  Places images 
			      in the local/postage directory.

   CREATION OF THE 'ON-OFF' SPECTRA FROM THE DATA CUBES:
generate_grs_spectra_local.pro -- Creates the GRS IDL structure and runs 
			       	  grsmatch.pro on each BGPS object to generate 
				  an 'On-Off' spectrum.  The data structure also
				  contains the 'on' and 'off' spectra and other 
				  relevant information.
generate_hi_spectra_local.pro  -- Creates the HI IDL structure and runs 
			       	  hisa.pro on each BGPS object to generate 
				  an 'On-Off' spectrum.  The data structure also
				  contains the 'on' and 'off' spectra and other 
				  relevant information.

   VELOCITY STRUCTURE CREATION AND POPULATION ROUTINES:
create_velocity_structure.pro -- Creates the velocity structure for holding 
			      	 spectra of all dense gas tracer velocities, 
				 plus GRS 13CO, based on the current parameters 
				 in galactic_params.pro.  Places strucutre into 
				 an IDL save file 
				 (local/bgps_velocity_struct.sav).
import_densegas_spectra.pro   -- Import the various dense gas tracer spectra 
			      	 into a single velocity structure for analysis.
