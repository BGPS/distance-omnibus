###========== README ==========###

This README is for the emaf/ directory of the distance-omnibus code repository.
These routines compute quantities related to the EMAF prior DPDF, as described 
in Ellsworth-Bowers et al. (2013, ApJ, 770, 39; EB13).

There are two classes of routines in this directory: use routines, and
autonomous routines.  The former may be run by the user to produce ancillary
output for verification, but the autonomous routines are called by higher-level
routines in the repository, and should not, generally, need to be called by the
user.


User Routines:
-------------------------
omni_mir_examine.pro   -- Creates the PostScript figures required for a by-eye
		       	  examination of EMAF candidates.  If this routine has
			  not been run, and the corresponding *_reject_emaf.txt
			  has not been created, distance_omnibus.pro will exit
			  with a notice to follow this step.

			  *** Important ***
			  Upon completion of the by-eye examination, create a
			  text file in the local/ directory containing the
			  catalog numbers of the sources not meeting the
			  selection criteria set out in EB13.
			  
Autonomous Routines:
-------------------------
omni_generate_emaf.pro -- Generates the list of EMAF-identified objects from 
		       	  the SURVEY catalog.  This routine is called from 
			  distance_omnibus.pro and should not need to be 
			  called independently.

omni_emaf_morph.pro    -- Performs the morphological matching between a SURVEY
		       	  catalog object and the GLIMPSE 8-um mosaics.  This
			  routine is called from distance_omnibus.pro and 
			  should not need to be called independently, but it 
			  may be used with driver_morph.pro for diagnostic
			  purposes.
			  
Data Files:
-------------------------
irdc_full_data.sav     -- IDL save file containing the Peretto & Fuller (2009,
		       	  A&A, 505,405) IRDC catalog.  This was required for
			  earlier implementations of distance-omnibus, but are
			  provided here for future development, as desired.
irdc_full_data.README  -- README describing the above file.
