The emaf/ directory contains the routines related to the EMAF prior DPDF, as
described in Ellsworth-Bowers et al. (2013, ApJ, 770, 39; EB13).

User Routines:
-------------------------
omni_mir_examine.pro   -- Creates the PostScript figures required for a by-eye
		       	  examination of EMAF candidates.  If this routine has
			  not been run, and the corresponding *_reject_emaf.txt
			  has not been created, distance_omnibus.pro will exit
			  with a notice to follow this step.

			  ** Important **
			  Upon completion of the by-eye examination, create a
			  text file in the local/ directory containing the
			  catalog numbers of the sources not meeting the
			  selection criteria set out in EB13.

driver_morph.pro       -- Debugging routine used to drive the morphological
		       	  matching in omni_emaf_morph.pro from outside
			  distance-omnibus.pro.
			  
Autonomous Routines:
-------------------------
omni_generate_emaf.pro -- Generates the list of EMAF-identified objects from 
		       	  the SURVEY catalog.  This routine is called from 
			  distance_omnibus.pro and should not need to be 
			  called independently.

omni_emaf_morph.pro    -- Performs the morphological matching between a SURVEY
		       	  catalog object and the GLIMPSE 8-um mosaics.  This
			  routine is called from distance_omnibus.pro and 
			  should not need to be called independently, but it 
			  may be used with driver_morph.pro for diagnostic
			  purposes.
