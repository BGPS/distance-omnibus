###========== README ==========###

This README is for the rot_curve/ directory of the distance-omnibus code
repository.  These routines provide a uniform interface for the remainder
of the code base, so that any rotation curve may be used.

Currently supported rotation curves:
------------------------------------

Reid et al. (2009, ApJ, 700, 137) flat rotation curve derived from parallax 
     measurements to H2O and CH3HO masers.  Specific values reflect updated
     values quoted at the MW2011 conference in Rome.

Clemens (1985, ApJ, 295, 422) rotation curve derived from 12CO observations
     of the Galactic plane.

IAU Standard rotation curve.



------------------------------------
Other rotation curves may be added to the code base by writing a new routine
     ?????_rotcurve.pro, based on the model provided in clemens_rotcurve.pro.
     Additionally, code must be added to omni_vphys2vlsr.pro to specify the
     radius and circular velocity of the Solar Circle, and V(R).
