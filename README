###========== README ==========###

This README describes the distance-omnibus code.

Distance-omnibus was developed by the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey team for
the purpose of resolving distances to BGPS sources.  While developed for the
BGPS, it had been structured for use with any (sub-)millimeter Galactic plane 
survey.

The code is based on a series of configuration files, which contain information
specific to the survey being used as well as the layout of local files and
other parameters.

Routines are written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), and are compatible
with IDL 7.x and 8.x (http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx).
Several external libraries are required for distance-omnibus routines:
   * IDLASTRO (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
   * The Coyote Graphics System (http://www.idlcoyote.com/idldoc/cg/index.html)
   * The Markwardt IDL Library (http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/)
