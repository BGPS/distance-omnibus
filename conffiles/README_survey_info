###========== README_survey_info ==========###

This README describes the parts of the survey_info.conf configuration file, 
where all survey-specific information is placed.  This includes locations of
map mosaics, source catalog, etc.

CTYPE  -- The type of configuration file.  This is survey-info.
SURVEY -- Name of the survey.  This string is used to name various derivative
       	  files used by the distance-omnibus code.

CAT    -- Location of the survey source catalog.  The catalog MUST be in AJ/ApJ
       	  style Machine Readable Format, with standards and conversion tool at
	  http://aas.org/authors/machine-readable-table-standards
	  http://authortools.aas.org/MRT/upload.html


######## Information about the map data products for the survey

MAPS   -- Many of the routines in the distance-omnibus code require cutouts
       	  from the survey map data around individual sources in the catalog.
	  This keyword is the filename (with path) of the text file containing
	  the filenames (with path) of the survey data images.

CROP   -- If the full images are provided, but were masked or cropped before
       	  cataloging took place, the routines need to know the cropping limits
	  (in Galactic Coordinates) for each image.  This keyword is the
	  filename of the text file containing this information.  Images must 
	  be specified in the same order as in MAPS.  This file has 5 columns:
	  fieldname, l_min, l_max, b_min, b_max
	  The cropping dimensions are only needed if LABEL maps do not exist.

LABEL  -- Many of the routines in the distance-omnibus code require a source
       	  outline for each entry in the catalog.  Label maps have the same
	  dimensions as MAPS, and are zero everywhere except for the locations
	  of cataloged sources.  Each source in a label map should be filled
	  with a different value to distinguish between adjacent objects.  It
	  is most convenient if the label maps are stored as type LONG.  This
	  keyword is the filename of the text file containing the filenames of
	  the survey LABEL maps, in the SAME ORDER as MAPS.

SMOOTH -- For visualization purposes, some surveys may produce smoothed
       	  versions of the map data.  Some routines in the distance-omnibus code
	  use these smoothed maps to plot flux density contours -- but such
	  maps are not required.
