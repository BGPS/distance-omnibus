###========== README ==========###

This README is for the conffiles/ directory of the distance-omnibus code
repository.  Configuration files are used to tell the code:
  1. Where to find the data products for the (sub-)millimeter dust continuum 
     survey being used with the code;
  2. Galactic parameters to be used, such as R0, rotation curve, etc.
  3. Which prior DPDFs to run, and in what order.
  4. Potentially any other information needed for a given purpose.
