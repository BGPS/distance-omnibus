This is the source repository for the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) effort to resolve distance measurements to catalog sources. Through the Bayesian application of prior Distance Probability Density Functions (DPDFs) derived from ancillary data to a kinematic distance likelihood, this code derives posterior DPDFs for catalog sources. This methodology is generalized for use with any (sub-)millimeter survey of the Galactic plane. 

The methodology was introduced in Ellsworth-Bowers et al. (2013, ApJ, 770, 39) and demonstrated on the BGPS version 1 data (Aguirre et al. 2011, ApJS, 192, 4).  An expansion of the distance methodology to include a new kinematic distance likelihood and prior DPDFs is presented in Ellsworth-Bowers et al. (2014, ApJ, vvv, ppp), and demonstrated on the re-reduced BGPS version 2 data (Ginsburg et al., 2013, ApJS, 208, 14).
