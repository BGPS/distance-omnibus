###========== README ==========###

This README is for the utils/ directory of the distance-omnibus code repository.
These routines are general-purpose utility routines that are neither specific 
to the distance-omnibus code base nor are found in the required external 
libraries.  Some of these utilities were written intially for distance-omnibus 
and others were gathered from elsewhere but used by the principal routines in 
this repository.

A description of the routines contained herein is not supplied, but feel free
to browse the file headers to figure out what each one does.


###****************************###
In addition to these routines, the following EXTERNAL LIBRARIES are required:

These libraries must be installed on the local machine and their paths included 
in the IDL path. The distance-omnibus code assumes you have a version of these 
libraries no older than the version current as of the distance-omnibus release date.

    IDLASTRO -- The IDL Astronomy User's Library
    	     (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/) or

    The Coyote Graphics System -- Device-independent plotting routines
    	     (http://www.idlcoyote.com/idldoc/cg/index.html) or
